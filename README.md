# TIGER2hs
TIGER2 hybrid solvent replica exchange implementations for NAMD

## Usage

Setup a NAMD simulation with TIGER2hs<sup>PE</sup> for one of the example system (AAQAA, HP7, TrpCage):

    #copy files
    cp -r <TIGER2 Repository Path>/systems/<system> simulation & cd simulation
    cp -r <TIGER2 Repository Path>/src/TIGER2hs_PE remd
    cp -r <TIGER2 Repository Path>/tools .
    cp remd/template.sh simulation.sh
    
Edit the `simulation.sh` and add values according to system's README. Then run the simulation:
    
    ./simulation.sh
    
You can monitor the sampling and exchange process by `get_samping.tcl` and `exmat.tcl`:

    ./tools/exmat.tcl
    ./remd/get_sampling.tcl <timestep>
    
Further information see: [tutorial/tutorial.md](tutorial/tutorial.md)

## Required software

We normally run our simulations with an MPI built of NAMD-2.13 or later. Our implementations work fine with CUDA enabled NAMD builts. Launch options in `template.sh` may need updates for `charmrun` and specialized compute clusters. 
The hybrid solvent energy is now generated by OpenMM and MDAnalysis and hence requires a python 3.7 environment with these packages installed.

## TODO

- [ ] Add parameters to choose between wrapped or unwrapped output for hybrid solvent state 
- [ ] Add option to write the trajectory for all replicas, not only the baseline

## Cite this work

We are currently preparing the manuscript for the new updates.
